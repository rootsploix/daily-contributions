## üõ°Ô∏è Security Features

### Advanced Threat Detection
```javascript
// Example: Real-time threat detection
const securityModule = new AdvancedSecurityModule();
const threats = securityModule.detectThreats(userInput);

if (threats.length > 0) {
    threats.forEach(threat => {
        console.log(`‚ö†Ô∏è ${threat.type} detected - ${threat.severity}`);
        console.log(`üîß Mitigation: ${threat.mitigation}`);
    });
}
```

### Security Scanning Results

## ‚ö° Performance Optimization

### Crypto Mining Performance
```python
# Example: High-performance crypto mining
optimizer = PerformanceOptimizer()
results = optimizer.optimize_crypto_mining(difficulty=4, duration=30)

print(f"Hash Rate: {results['hash_rate_per_second']:,} H/s")
print(f"Golden Hashes Found: {results['golden_hashes_found']}")
```

### Vulnerability Scanning Performance
```python
# Example: High-speed vulnerability scanning
scan_results = optimizer.optimize_vulnerability_scanning(target_count=1000)

print(f"Scan Rate: {scan_results['scan_rate_per_second']:,} targets/s")
print(f"Vulnerabilities Found: {scan_results['vulnerabilities_found']}")
```
