- **Social Engineering** - Human factors outside of technical controls
- **Physical Security** - Physical access to systems running our tools

#### üéØ Excluded Areas:
- **Third-party Dependencies** - Vulnerabilities in external libraries (report to upstream)
- **Configuration Issues** - Misconfigurations in user deployments
- **Network Security** - Network-level attacks outside our control
- **Operating System** - OS-level vulnerabilities not specific to our code

### ‚öñÔ∏è Legal Considerations

#### üìú Responsible Research Guidelines

When researching security vulnerabilities:

1. **Authorization** - Only test on systems you own or have explicit permission to test
2. **No Harm** - Do not cause damage or access unauthorized data
3. **Disclosure** - Follow responsible disclosure practices
4. **Legal Compliance** - Ensure your research complies with applicable laws

#### üõ°Ô∏è Safe Harbor

We commit to:

- **No Legal Action** - We will not pursue legal action against researchers who follow our responsible disclosure policy
- **Good Faith** - We assume good faith from security researchers
- **Coordinated Disclosure** - We will work with researchers on disclosure timing
