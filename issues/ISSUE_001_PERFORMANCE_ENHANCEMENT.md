**Issue Type:** Feature Enhancement  
**Priority:** High  
**Labels:** `enhancement`, `performance`, `ai-ml`, `python`  
**Milestone:** v2.0.0 Performance Improvements  

## üìã Current State Analysis

### Existing Performance Metrics
- **Current Hash Rate:** ~50,000 H/s (CPU-only)
- **Memory Usage:** 1.2GB average for medium workloads
- **GPU Utilization:** Not implemented
- **Scaling Limit:** Single-node deployment only

### Performance Bottlenecks Identified

2. **Memory Allocation** - Inefficient object creation/destruction patterns
3. **ML Model Loading** - Cold start delays for TensorFlow/PyTorch models
4. **Data Pipeline** - Synchronous data processing causing I/O blocks

## üéØ Proposed Enhancements

### 1. GPU Acceleration Implementation
```python
# Proposed CUDA integration for mining operations
import cupy as cp
import tensorflow as tf

class GPUAcceleratedMining:
    def __init__(self, device_count=None):
        self.devices = tf.config.experimental.list_physical_devices('GPU')
        self.mining_kernels = self._compile_cuda_kernels()
    
    def gpu_hash_computation(self, data_batch):
        # CUDA-accelerated SHA-256 computation
        gpu_data = cp.asarray(data_batch)
        return self.mining_kernels.batch_hash(gpu_data)
```

### 2. Memory Pool Management
```python
# Proposed memory pooling system
class MemoryPoolManager:
    def __init__(self, pool_size_mb=2048):
        self.memory_pool = tf.config.experimental.memory_growth = True
        self.object_pool = ObjectPool(max_size=10000)
    
    def get_reusable_tensor(self, shape, dtype):
        return self.object_pool.get_or_create(shape, dtype)
```

### 3. Asynchronous ML Pipeline
```python
# Proposed async ML processing
async def async_threat_detection(self, data_stream):
    async with AsyncMLModelManager() as models:
        tasks = []
        async for batch in data_stream:
            task = asyncio.create_task(
                models.predict_batch(batch)
            )
            tasks.append(task)
        
        results = await asyncio.gather(*tasks)
        return self.aggregate_predictions(results)
```
